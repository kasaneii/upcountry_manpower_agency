## 🚀 The Problem & Solution
**The Problem:** As a Sri Lanka–based agency, UMA needed a high-trust digital presence to connect local talent with international employers. The existing challenge was presenting complex recruitment data in a clean, authoritative way that appealed to both job seekers and global corporate partners.

**The Solution:** I developed a structured website using a custom WordPress architecture. By blending custom PHP logic with a responsive Bootstrap frontend, I created a reliable ecosystem for manpower solutions that balances professional aesthetics with easy content management.
